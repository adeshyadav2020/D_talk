# D_talk
This was a group project done by me and 3 other members of my class where we have created a demo application named Dtalk for predicting the possible disease using the symptoms of patient.
DtaLK is an android application that helps our users to connect with their doctors online. User can choose any of the Specialized Doctors from the list and can have a real-time chat with their doctors. DtaLK is also equipped with another exciting feature of Disease Prediction model which is based on ML algorithms.
