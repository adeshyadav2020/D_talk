# D_talk
This was a group project done by me and 3 other members of my class where we have created a demo application named Dtalk for predicting the possible disease using the symptoms of patient.
DtaLK is an android application that helps our users to connect with their doctors online. User can choose any of the Specialized Doctors from the list and can have a real-time chat with their doctors. DtaLK is also equipped with another exciting feature of Disease Prediction model which is based on ML algorithms.
Objective of the work To provide Disease Prediction models to predict from which disease our user is suffering from. To ensure that users just have to provide their symptoms into the app and ML model will predict userâ€™s disease and provide the appropriate Doctors.
Requirements : Go to android studio and run our graddle file which will run the application in your system.
